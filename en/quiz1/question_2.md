A young creator has created a 'CameraController' script that will follow a ball down a track. They keep getting the error `variable cameraTransform not been assigned`. What should they do to fix this error?

--- choices ---

- ( ) Add a Camera GameObject to your scene. 

  --- feedback ---

   Not quite, your project should already have a main camera that will be used with your project. 

  --- /feedback ---

- (x) Drag the 'Main Camera' GameObject to the 'Camera Transform' property for the script.  

  --- feedback ---

  Correct! They have written their script correctly but they haven't told Unity which camera to control. 

  --- /feedback ---

  - ( ) Delete the `cameraTransform` variable from the `CameraController` script.

  --- feedback ---

 Not quite. The script will need the `cameraTransform` variable to be set so it can move the camera.
