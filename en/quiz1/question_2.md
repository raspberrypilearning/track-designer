In what way could the 'Scene view' be different to the 'Game view' when the scene is in play mode?

- ( ) Object materials

   Close! It's true that objects may have a different material in the Scene view that are then changed by code when the game is playing. This is not the only difference though.

- ( ) View perspective 

  --- feedback ---

  Close! It's true that the Scene view perspective can be changed manually or via the Scene gizmo. The player will see the perspective of the camera, which could be different to the scene view. This is not the only difference though.

  - ( ) Object visibility

  --- feedback ---

  Close! It's true that objects may be visible/invisible in the Scene view but be hidden/shown by code when the game is playing. This is not the only difference though.

  Correct. These are all ways that the 'Scene' view could be different from the 'Game' view.
