You want to create a physics material that will make a GameObject very bouncy. Which value will create the highest level of bounciness?

--- choices ---

- ( ) 

`0`

  --- feedback ---

Try again. `0` would not provide any bouncy effects for your GameObject.

- ( )

`0.5`

  --- feedback ---

  
Not quite. A bounciness of `0.5` will make a ball quite bouncy, but it will gradually stop bouncing.

- (x) 

`1`

  --- feedback ---

Correct! A bounciness value of `1` will make the ball very bouncy. It will keep bouncing without losing energy.
