A CoderDojo creator has placed a new object into their scene. It is positioned really high up and too close to the camera. What is the quickest way to move the GameObject to the centre of the scene?

--- choices ---

- (x) Reset the transform

  --- feedback ---

Correct! In the 'Inspector' window, you can choose to 'Reset' the transform. This will set the 'Position' and 'Rotation' values to 0 and will move your GameObject to the centre.

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) Use the 'Position' gizmo (the X, Y, Z handles) to manually move the GameObject to the centre.

  --- feedback ---

This would eventually move your GameObject to the centre but it is not the quickest way to do it.
