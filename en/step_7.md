## Upgrade your project

Change the style of your game or add more. 

You could:
+ Use `Save As` to create a copy of your scene and create another pixel art image.
+ Choose or create different materials to create your pixel art.
+ Add sound effects for each tile colour when it is revealed. 
+ Add a spotlight that follows the player

You could add another player that uses different keys. The second player could:
+ Help reveal the pixel art
+ Change the revealed tiles back to their start material to slow the reveal
+ Move faster or slower than the first player
