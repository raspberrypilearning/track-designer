## Design the track

In this step, you will design your track using the parts available in the parts folder.  

![A strip of examples showing different options for how a track could be designed. The first is a track with spirals, curved ramps and is coloured in pink and black, the second uses cube GameObjects with a hidden rainbow path, the third uses several spirals on top of each other.](images/output2-strip.png)

### Create a project with the starter package

--- task ---

Launch the Unity Hub and click **Projects** then select **New project**:

![A screenshot of the black bar at the top of the Unity Hub with the 'New Project' button highlighted in red.](images/new-project.png)

Edit the project settings to give your project a name such as 'Pixel art reveal' and save it to a sensible location. Then click **Create project**.

Your new project will open in the Unity Editor. It may take some time to load.

In the pop-up window, name your Scene `Track-Designer` or choose your own name:

A new file will appear in the Assets folder in the Project window.

### Add a floor

--- task ---

Right-click on your scene in the Hierarchy window and choose **GameObject > 3D Object > Plane**.

This will create a ground for your track to sit on.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Choose** a size for your plane by changing the 'X' and 'Z' scale values.

Our example changes the 'Z' value to `2`:

--- /task ---

--- task ---

In the Project window, click on **Materials > Obstacle Materials**.

**Choose** a material for your plane and drag it onto the 'Scene' view. 

Our example uses the 'Concrete' material:

### Design your track structure

--- task ---

**Choose** where to place the goal for your track. 

In the 'Project' window, go to 'Assets -> Parts'.

Drag in the goal part to your scene. 

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Change** the 'Transform Position' values to X=`0`, Y=`0`, Z=`0` to start your part in the middle of your scene. 

Move your goal part until you are satisfied with where it is positioned.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

It is practical to create your track from the **last** part to the **first**. 

**Choose** the final part of your track that will link to your goal part. 

Drag in your part and position it next to your goal.

**Tip**: Look at your parts from lots of different angles to make sure that they are lined up correctly.

**Tip**: It is OK to move your goal to a new position if you have decided it doesn't work where it is currently located.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Add in the remaining parts for your track. Continue to add parts from the bottom to the top.

**Tip**: Make sure that the ball can roll down towards the goal.

![All of the parts have now been added to the scene. There is a curved ramp that leads to two spirals and then another two curved ramps.](images/all-parts.png)

--- /task ---

### Add materials to your track

--- task ---

**Choose:** a material for each piece in your track. 

In the Project window, go to **Materials > ObstacleMaterials**. Drag a coloured material onto each piece in the Scene view.   

![The example track is now coloured in using pink and black colours to make a vibrant effect.](images/track-materials.png)
