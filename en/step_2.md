## Design the track

In this step, you will design your track using the parts available in the parts folder.  

![A strip of examples showing different options for how a track could be designed. The first is a track with spirals, curved ramps and is coloured in pink and black, the second uses cube GameObjects with a hidden rainbow path, the third uses several spirals on top of each other.](images/output2-strip.png)

### Create a project with the starter package

--- task ---

Launch the Unity Hub and click **Projects** then select **New project**:

![A screenshot of the black bar at the top of the Unity Hub with the 'New Project' button highlighted in red.](images/new-project.png)

From the list choose **All templates** then select **3D Core**:

![A screenshot of the left pane in the Unity Hub. The 3D core option is highlighted in red.](images/3D-core.png)

Edit the project settings to give your project a name such as 'Pixel art reveal' and save it to a sensible location. Then click **Create project**.

Your new project will open in the Unity Editor. It may take some time to load.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

The Unity starter package you downloaded for this More Unity path contains a number of **Assets** for you to use in your project.

To import them into your new project, click on the **Assets menu** and select **Import package > Custom Packageâ€¦** then navigate to the downloaded Unity starter package.

Download and unzip the [More Unity starter package](https://rpf.io/p/en/rainbow-run-go){:target="_blank"} to your computer. 

**Tip:** Choose a sensible location such as your Documents folder.

Right-click on **SampleScene** in the Hierarchy and choose **Save Scene As**: 

![The scene icon in the Hierarchy window with the right-click menu expanded.](images/right-click-scene.png)

In the pop-up window, name your Scene `Track-Designer` or choose your own name:

A new file will appear in the Assets folder in the Project window.

### Add a floor

--- task ---

Right-click on your scene in the Hierarchy window and choose **GameObject > 3D Object > Plane**.

This will create a ground for your track to sit on.

[[[unity-plane]]]

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Choose** a size for your plane by changing the 'X' and 'Z' scale values.

Our example changes the 'Z' value to `2`:

### Design your track structure

Your track needs:
+ A start
+ Middle pieces
+ A goal 

It is practical to create your track from the **last** part (the goal) to the **first** part (the start). 

**Tip**: Make sure that you design your track so that the ball can roll down towards the goal.

--- task ---

**Choose** your goal and drag the part into your scene. You could:
+ Use the plane as the goal
+ Use the existing 'goal' part from the 'Assets -> Parts' folder
+ Create your own goal from 3D objects

[[[unity-model-gameobject]]]
[[[unity-3d-objects]]]

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Set the transform position, rotation and scale of your goal until you are satisfied with where it is positioned.  

**Tip:** The 'Transform Position' values X=`0`, Y=`0`, Z=`0` start your goal in the middle of your scene.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Choose** your parts one at a time starting with the part that links to your goal. 

Each time change the transform position, rotation, and scale if needed and make sure the track position lines up with the previous part. 

![A final piece of track is positioned next to the goal.](images/final-part.png)

**Tip**: Look at your parts from lots of different angles to make sure that they are lined up correctly.

**Tip**: It is OK to change the position of previous parts as you design and build your track.

ADD IN A SCENE GIZMO INGREDIENT!!!

![All of the parts have now been added to the scene. There is a curved ramp that leads to two spirals and then another two curved ramps.](images/all-parts.png)

### Add materials to your scene

--- task ---

**Choose:** a material for each piece in your track. 

In the Project window, go to **Materials > ObstacleMaterials**. Drag a coloured material onto each piece in the Scene view.
