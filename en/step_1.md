## You will make

In this project you will design your own track to roll a ball down using **tilt**. You will also add in your own interactive objects to the track. You will choose whether the camera follows the ball or stays in the same place. 

You will:

+ Design a track by arranging GameObjects in the Scene view and adding spinning obstacles
+ Choose Materials for the ball, the track and all the obstacles
+ Decide whether the camera will follow the ball or stay still
+ Configure physics materials to control how objects interact

### You will need

This project requires the Unity Editor, which can be installed from the Unity Hub. This is a large download and install, so we recommend you install it before starting this project.

You can follow our [Unity guide](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/unity-guide){:target="_blank"} to install Unity Hub and the Unity Editor for your operating system.

You will also need to download the [More Unity starter package](https://rpf.io/p/en/rainbow-run-go){:target="_blank"} of assets before starting.
