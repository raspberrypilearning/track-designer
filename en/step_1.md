## You will make

In this project you will design your own track to roll a ball down. You will also add in your own interactive objects to the track. You will choose whether the user will control or watch the ball. 

You will:

+ Design a track by arranging GameObjects in the Scene view and adding spinning obstacles
+ Decide whether the player will control the ball and how the camera will work
+ Configure physics materials to control how objects interact

### Get ideas ðŸ’­

You are going to make some design decisions to build own track.

Explore these example projects to get more ideas:
