## You will make

In this project, you will design your own track to roll a ball down using **tilt**. You will also add in your own interactive objects to the track. You will choose whether the camera follows the ball or stays in the same place. 

You will:

+ Design a track by arranging GameObjects in the Scene view and adding spinning obstacles
+ Choose Materials for the ball, the track and all the obstacles
+ Decide whether the camera will follow the ball or stay still
+ Configure physics materials to control how objects interact

### You will need

This project requires the Unity Editor, which can be installed from the Unity Hub. This is a large download and install, so we recommend you install it before starting this project.

You can follow our [Unity guide](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/unity-guide){:target="_blank"} to install the Unity Hub and the Unity Editor for your operating system.

### Get ideas ðŸ’­

You are going to make some design decisions to build your own track.
